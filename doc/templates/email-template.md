Who should you email?
---------------------------------------------------------

I'd probably suggest emailing your Federal MP. NBN is a federal responsibility - so there's unfortunately probably little value in contacting your state MP or council.

Determine who your Federal MP is by searching here: [https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Members](https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Members)

> Hi {insert-federal-MPs-name-here},
> 
> I am a member of your electorate living at {your-address}. I reach out to you with a matter of increasing annoyance and agitation for many members of your electorate as well as for me and my wife... NBN.
> 
> For the past 2 months I regularly have internet outages for 10 to 30 minutes an hour. I have a long running TIO ticket {ticket-number}. I also have an NBN incident number {insert-incident-number} and NBN complaint number {insert-complaint-number}. My RSP is {insert-RSP-name} and refers to this as issue {insert-RSP-issue-reference-here}.
> 
> We had our 4th NBN sub-contractor from a company called Service Stream visit over the weekend - the issue remains unresolved. We explicitly requested NBN send out a qualified technician - but they keep sending out the same not suitable qualified technicians. In an ideal situation, all we're asking for is reliable internet (like we had before we moved to NBN HFC when we were with Telstra Cable using exactly the same infrastructure/cables).
> 
> I can describe the issues we are personally experiencing with a large amount of technical detail - if you're interested I document some of it here: https://github.com/nbnsucks/hfcmon#example-outputs-from-hfc-monitor-hfcmon . However I'm yet to speak to a single NBN representative who's been able to speak to me technically about my issue. This is absurd given it's been over 2 month.
> 
> I document some policy changes I believe should be implemented ASAP. I would personally value your inspection, evaluation and response to each of these suggestions. These policy changes are documented here: https://github.com/nbnsucks/hfcmon#nbn-policy-suggestions
> 
> In the short term however, anything you can do to get my NBN HFC internet fixed ASAP would be appreciated. Alternatively, before NBN if we had this issue with Telstra Cable we'd have switched to Optus Cable - NBN has a monopoly on internet in my area - could I ask what you're doing to resolve this?
